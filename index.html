            <p>Hello! My name is Yasmin! I am a 3rd year student at Wayne. My major is Information Technology with a minor in Business Administration. 
            I am 20 years old and a Virgo! A fun fact about me is that I am Canadian! I enjoy reading, crafting, and watching tv! I also enjoy coding in HTML/CSS, Java, and C++.
            I would like to work in Cybersecurity after I graduate! I don't have a specific role in mind right now but I do know that's the field I want to go into. It just seems fun
            dealing with guidelines and ethical problems like that.
